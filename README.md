A some kind of lottery in ethereum blockchain

I'm trying to do some kind of lottery in the ethereum blockchain, I use javascript and a HTML page to interact with the smart contract.

There are many problems to fix in the smart contract, like security/functions visibility adjustment/gas cost..

TODO (Javascript): function display winners, function buy crypto
