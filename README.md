# Ethereum-lottery

I'm trying to do some kind of lottery in the ethereum blockchain, I use javascript and a HTML page to interact with the smart contract.

The idea is to use a smart contract as a "treasury" which automatically draws N winners among all those who have bought a "ticket" via the HTML page.
The "ticket" is nothing more than an ETH transaction addressed to the smart contract

There are many problems to fix in the smart contract, like security/functions visibility adjustment/gas cost..

TODO (Javascript): interaction Js-Smart contract (es. function display winners)
